## API Creation Proccess

* Creating a new Rails API

    Firstly  we run the following command to create a new rails api:
    $ rails new Pizza_Restaurant --api --minimal

* Generating the required Resources

    Run the following commands to generate the three resources

    1. $ rails g resource Pizza name ingredients --no-test-framework
    2. $ rails g resource Restaurant name address --no-test-framework
    3. $ rails g resource Restaurant_pizza price:integer restaurant_id:belongs_to pizza_id:belongs_to --no-test-framework

* Model Relationships

    - A `Restaurant` has many `Pizza`s through `RestaurantPizza`

    - A `Pizza` has many `Restaurants through `RestaurantPizza`

    - A `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant` and belongs to a `Pizza`

## ROUTES

    Each resource has it own specific routes as specified in the ./configroutes.rb folder .
    
     Pizzas routes; resources :pizzas, only: [:index, :create]

     Restaurants routes; resources :restaurants, only: [:index, :show, :destroy, :create]
    
     Restaurant_pizzas routes; resources :restaurant_pizzas, only: [:create, :index, :destroy]
